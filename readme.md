# LC3 VM

Made to supplement my "Intro to Computer Architecture" course at Imperial College London.

You can test the following lc3 .obj files:
    - 2048.obj (the game 2048)
    - rogue.obj (a rogue-like exploration thing)


You can use the LC3 assembler using:
    - `python3 lc3-assembler.py [file]`

Supports:
    - LC3 Architecture

Goals:
    - Debugger (live register / memory tracker tool like `gdb`)
    - Web interface?
    - MISP architecture support
